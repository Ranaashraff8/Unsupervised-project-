Table of content
- Project Overview.
    - This project is performing customer segmentation using K-means cluster algorithm on an online retail dataset, explore and understand it's structure and content.
    -  Numeric features (Quantity, UnitPrice, CustomerID) are selected for clustering.
    -  The Elbow Method is applied to determine the optimal number of clusters (K)
- Visualization:
     - The Elbow Method plot helps visualize the optimal number of clusters by identifying the "elbow point" where WCSS starts to decrease at a slower rate.
     - Plotly for interactive plots, Matplotlib for static plots.
- Tools:
    - Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn (for K-means and scaling))
    - Jupyter Notebooks
    - Online retail Data
